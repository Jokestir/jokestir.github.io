* <!DOCTYPE html> :  document type declaration and it lets the browser know which flavor of HTML you’re using (HTML5, in this case)

* <html> : opening tag that kicks things off and tells the browser that everything between that and the </html> closing tag is an HTML document.

* <body> and </body> : is the main content of the document that will appear in the browser window. (this is what you should show!)


----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:

Not all tags have closing tags like this (<html></html>) some tags, which do not wrap around content will close themselves. 

The line-break tag for example, looks like this : <br> - a line break doesn’t hold any content so the tag merrily sits by its lonely self

self-closing” tags, whereby a br tag, for example, will look like “<br />” instead of simply “<br>”.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Tags: basic structure of an HTML document includes tags, which surround content and apply meaning to it.

				Example : <html></html>

* Attributes: tags have attributes which have extra information. Attributes appear inside the opening tag and their values sit inside quotation marks. 
			
				Example : <tag attribute="value">Margarine</tag>

			
----------------
NOTE:
Once again, quotation marks aren’t always essential but it is a good-practice convention HTML Dog uses for consistency and clarity. We suggest you do the same.

*  elements : tags mark the end and beginning of an element

		“<title>Rumple Stiltskin</title>” is a title element.


Some element
----------


*  title elemnt: All html pages should have a page title.


*  head element : info about the page. is not printed. comes before body

* body element : stuff that is printed



			<html>
				<head>
    					<title>My first web page</title>
				</head>
				<body>
    					This is my first web page
				</body>
			</html>

* paragraph tag: for text to go on next line. <p></p>

* <em></em>, <strong></strong> (emphasis)

* <br> (line break) no closing tag

* heading elements : h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 

* list : <ul>, <ol> (unordered list and ordered list)

* link : anchor tag.href attribute has the destination link eg: <a href="flyingmoss.html">The miracle of moss inflight</a>  (relative link if in same directory)

* img  : src, width, height and alt attributes. e.g: <img src="http://www.htmldog.com/badge1.gif" width="120" height="90" alt="HTML Dog"> (noclosing tag)

* table: table tag, tr is row tag and td is data tag.

			
			<table>
    				<tr>
        				<td>Row 1, cell 1</td>
        				<td>Row 1, cell 2</td>
        				<td>Row 1, cell 3</td>
    				</tr>
    				<tr>
        				<td>Row 2, cell 1</td>
        				<td>Row 2, cell 2</td>
        				<td>Row 2, cell 3</td>
    				</tr>
    
				</table>

FORM
--------

* forms are used to take input from user.

* method attribute tells how data can be sent. get and put are most popular options.

-------------------------------------------------
NOTE

get is used for shorter chunks of non-sensitive information - you might see the information you have submitted in a web site’s search to appear in the web address of its search results page, for example. post is used for lengthier, more secure submissions, such as in contact forms.

---------------------------------------------------

* input tag : input area for data

				- <input type="text"> : standard text box. can also have a value attribute, which sets the initial text in the textbox
				- <input type="password"> is similar to the textbox, but the characters typed in by the user will be hidden.
				- <input type="checkbox"> : checkbox, which can be toggled on and off by the user. can have a checked attribute (<input type="checkbox" 				   	   checked> - the attribute doesn’t require a value) 

				- <input type="radio"> :the user can only select one radio button in a group. This can also have a checked attribute.
				- <input type="submit"> is a button that when selected will submit the form. You can control the text that appears on the submit button 				   	   with the value attribute, for example <input type="submit" value="Ooo. Look. Text on a button. Wow">.
				


* textarea tag :  a large, multi-line textbox. The anticipated number of rows and columns can be defined with rows and cols attributes

				<textarea rows="5" cols="20">A big load of text</textarea> (initial value)


* select tag :  works with the option tag to make drop-down select boxes.


			<select>
    				<option>Option 1</option>
    				<option>Option 2</option>
    				<option value="third option">Option 3</option>
			</select

			<option selected>Rodent</option> (rodent is default selected)

* to all the fields, the attribute name needs to be added, for example <input type="text" name="talkingsponge">.The name attribute is used to reference elements in a   JavaScript, or to reference form data after a form is submitted.
