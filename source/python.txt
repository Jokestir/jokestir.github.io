## minimalism

  > simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
- classes are evil. use functions. think in terms of functions and datastructures.
            - think in terms of map, filter, reduce.
- threads are evil. ()
            - dont use threads. use process.
- favorite datastructures: sets, dicts, structs, namedtuples and tuples, txt, config, shelve, json, sqlite, trees

## structure

* code.py       // single file for everything. just like levelsio. bottle.py or django
* settings.conf // store configs
* assets	// css, jquery, html, includes
* data		// data in the form of json, xml, sqlite
* logging	// logs go here. loguru

## frameworks

* web: bottle.py, brython
* mobile: kivy
* desktop: pysimplegui, tkinter
* textblob, fastext, keras for ml
