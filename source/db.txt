[0.4] Database design
---------------------

> Instead, they keep a Thing Table and a Data Table. 
> Everything in Reddit is a Thing: users, links, comments, subreddits, awards, etc. 
> Things keep common attribute like up/down votes, a type, and creation date. 
> The Data table has three columns: thing id, key, value. 
> There’s a row for every attribute. There’s a row for title, url, author, spam votes, etc. 
> When they add new features they didn’t have to worry about the database anymore. 
> They didn’t have to add new tables for new things or worry about upgrades. 
> Easier for development, deployment, maintenance.  The price is you can’t use cool relational features. 
> There are no joins in the database and you must manually enforce consistency. 
> No joins means it’s really easy to distribute data to different machines. 
> You don’t have to worry about foreign keys are doing joins or how to split the data up.
> Worked out really well. Worries of using a relational database are a thing of the past.
